# CBW HT-seq Module 7 - Galaxy lab

 
by Florence Cavalli


## Introduction

This workshop will show you how to use Galaxy and performed the anaylis you ran in Module 2 and Module 5 with Galaxy.
We are therefore using the dataset from NA12878 patient (reads extracted from region chr1:17704860-18004860)

We will use the galaxy website: https://usegalaxy.org/
Start by loging on the website with your username

The paramaters that need to be set or changed are specified in the text below (and in the images), keep the rest of the parameters with their default values

** indicate the tool to use that you need to select from the left column

### Data files

1) Load the data 
** Get Data/Upload File
